I am Senior Lecturer in Digital Studies at the University of Melbourne.

I co-ordinate the [Digital Studies](https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/minor/digital-studies-minor/) minor in the Faculty of Arts. I teach [students to code](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/arts20001). I teach them about the [history of computing](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/arts10003), and I teach them about [the place of the Humanities and Social Sciences in that history](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/arts30003).

I am a literary scholar by training, and a programmer by fascination. I connect these two sides of my work in two ways. The first way: I use computation to unweave literary texts, and discover beautiful patterns in their words. The second way: I use literature to unweave computation, drawing on the rich resources of literary tradition to understand the nature and role of software.

In my book _[Romanticism and the Contingent Self](https://link.springer.com/book/9783031499586)_, I explore what it meant to 'have no self' in Romantic literature. The Romantics are often seen as the most self-obsessed writers in the history of Western literature. I show how a whole host of wonderful writers questioned the very existenc of the self. [Charles Harpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Harpur), [Maria Edgeworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Edgeworth), [Thomas Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Moore), [Charlotte Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Smith_(writer)), [John Clare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clare), [Amelia Opie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Opie) and [Joanna Baille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Baillie) all portray themselves or their characters as _monstrosities_ or _multiplicities_ rather than _individuals_. To show how they do this, I [put their words under the microscope in R and Python](https://github.com/michaelgfalk/romantic-self).
