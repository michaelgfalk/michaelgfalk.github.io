[DHA25](https://dha25.org) is this week, as is the annual [CAPOS meeting](https://inke.ca/re-defining-open-social-scholarship-in-an-age-of-generative-intelligence/). I'll be giving [lots of presentations]({% post_url 2025-12-01-dha25 %}), and enjoying the fabulous keynotes from Jill Walker Rettberg and Kat Gledhill-Tucker. Lots of other goodies in store too.
