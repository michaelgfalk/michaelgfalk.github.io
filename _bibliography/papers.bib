	abstract = {This book offers a new critique of selfhood in Romantic literature. In the past, Romanticism has been seen as an individualistic movement, with writers believing in the ‘centrality’ of the self. Challenging this prevailing view of Romanticism and the modern self, this study unveils an alternative tradition of Romantic writing in which the self is fragile, degenerate, non-existent – or in a word, contingent. It combines philosophy, intellectual history, literary studies and digital humanities and takes a transnational approach both in its coverage of philosophical thought and literature, including case studies from England, Ireland, Scotland and colonial Australia, with examples from American and European works as well. The book also uses innovative digital techniques such as text analysis, sentiment mining and network analysis to enrich the exploration of text and context. It covers all major genres of Romantic writing: fiction (realist novels), poetry (the sonnet), non-fiction prose (biography) and drama (gothic tragedy). Providing a new framework for understanding the contingent self, this book is of interest to scholars and students of Romantic literature, philosophy of the self and digital humanities.},

	abstract = {Eliza Hamilton Dunlop (1796-1880) and Charles Harpur (1813-1867) were two of the most important Romantic poets of colonial New South Wales. In this article, I consider their engagement with Indigenous Australian languages. In 'Native Song' (1848), Dunlop provides a transcription and translation of verse composed by her informant Wulatji (fl. 1840s), a famous Awabakal poet. In 'The Kangaroo Hunt' (c. 1844), Harpur enriches his description of Australian landscapes with a dozen words learned from Darkinyung, Gamilaraay and Wonnarua informants. I contrast Dunlop's universalist approach to Indigenous langauge with Harpur's particularist approach, and contextualise their poetry in British philosophy of language. Dunlop and Harpur use Indigenous language to present Australia as a land steeped in poetry, but their recognition of Indigenous poetry undermines their own attempts to make themselves at home in the colony.},

The encyclopedia is usually treated as a representation of global trends. We now have excellent studies that have demonstrated how Wikipedia represents men at the expense of women (e.g. see Konieczny and Klein 2018), and people and places in North America and Western Europe rather than the Majority World (e.g. see Beytía 2020). But we have very few quantitative national studies of Wikipedia. In this, our first year of the wikihistories project, our focus is on how Wikipedia represents people. We ask how English Wikipedia represents Australians. Do we see the same trends in terms of gender and ethnicity so that globally studies of Wikipedia have identified? How well has English Wikipedia done over time to represent people in Australia?},

Though superintelligence is theoretically possible, it distracts from a more pressing problem: the rise of Artificial Stupidity (AS). This article discusses the cultural roots of Frankenstein Syndrome, and provides a conceptual framework for evaluating the stupidity of artificial agents. It then identifies an alternative literary tradition that exposes the perils and benefits of AS. In the writings of Edmund Spenser, Jonathan Swift and E.T.A. Hoffmann, ASs replace, enslave or delude their human users. More optimistically, Joseph Furphy and Laurence Sterne imagine ASs that can augment human intelligence by serving as maps or as pipes. These writers provide a strong counternarrative to the myths that currently drive the AI debate. They identify ways even stupid agents can thwart human aims, and demonstrate the social and scientific value of literary texts.},

	abstract = {Charles Harpur was the oustanding radical intellectual of early nineteenth-century New South Wales. His particular brand of spiritualised republicanism has long been of interest to scholars, but hitherto analysts of his politics have focussed mainly on the content of his opinions, rather than the form in which he expressed them. In this essay, I present a formalist analysis of Harpur's poetry, revealing how he structured his verse to express his radical convictions. His finest poems are inevitably perspectival and progressive. He was a pluralist who sought to represent reality from a range of perspectives; and he was an idealist who described objects in terms of their progressive growth toward higher forms. If we recognise these two elements of his poetics, we can come to a truer understanding of his politics and a fairer assessment of his achievement as a poet.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence has a rich history in literature; fiction has shaped how we view artificial agents and their capacities in the real world. This paper looks at embodied examples of human-machine co-creation from the literature of the Long Eighteenth Century (1650-1850), examining how older depictions of creative machines could inform and inspire modern day research. The works are analysed from the perspective of design fiction with special focus on the embodiment of the systems and the creativity exhibited by them. We find that the chosen examples highlight the importance of recognising the environment as a major factor in human-machine co-creative processes and that some of the works seem to precede current examples of artificial systems reaching into our everyday lives. The examples present embodied interaction in a positive, creativity-oriented way, but also highlight ethical risks of human-machine co-creativity. Modern day perceptions of artificial systems and creativity can be limited to some extent by the technologies available; fictitious examples from centuries past allow us to examine such limitations using a Design Fiction approach. These examples vividly capture some of the ideals concerning creativity support and co-creativity during the time, which can be used as inspirations for future work.},

It outlines the history of humanities computing and digital humanities, its evolution as a discipline, including its institutional development and outstanding challenges it faces. It also considers some of the most cogent critiques digital humanities has faced, particularly from North American-based literary scholars, some of whom have suggested it represents a threat to centuries-old traditions of humanistic inquiry and particularly to literary scholarship based on the tradition of close reading. The article shows instead that digital humanities approaches gainfully employed offer powerful new means of illuminating both context and content of texts, to assist with both close and distant readings, offering a supplement rather than a replacement for traditional means of literary inquiry. The digital techniques it discusses include stylometry, topic modeling, literary mapping, historical bibliometrics, corpus linguistic techniques, and sequence alignment, as well as some of the contributions that they have made. Further, the article explains how many key aspirations of digital humanities scholarship, including interoperability and linked open data, have yet to be realized, and it considers some of the projects that are currently making this possible and the challenges that they face. The article concludes on a slightly cautionary note: What are the implications of the digital humanities for literary study? It is too early to tell.},

For much of the 20th century, computational scholars had focussed on details, compiling exhaustive concordances of classic texts, densely tagged databases of stylistic examples, or comprehensive digital editions of famous writers. But in the 2000s, scholars acquired a new aspiration: to data mine the archive, and model world literature as a whole. In this chapter, I look back on these 20 years of effort, and take stock. What does it mean to “model” world literature? And how is such modelling affected by digital technology? I contrast three models of world literature: the canon, the cosmopolis, and the archive. In each case, I show how the particular model implies a certain research method, and then consider how that method may be assisted or transformed by digital technology. To conclude, I consider Kath Bode and Roopika Risam’s powerful materialist critiques of digital literary scholarship, and suggest that scholars should embrace orthogonality as the underlying principle of world literary history.},

such a case study reveal wider information about the, rhythms, networks and scale of the
trade? These are questions we seek to address in this study. In the process we hope to shed
fresh light on the practices, materials, and networks of the early modern paper trade in
Europe, particularly the mechanisms by which printers and publishers attempted to ensure a
regular supply of paper to their workshops. By analyzing the supply and demand for paper
from a single company’s business records across a time span of almost two decades, our
study illuminates the business practices of paper traders, and the interplay of supply networks
and purchasing strategies of major paper buyers in early modern Europe.},
