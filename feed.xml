There have been many bubbles before, from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania">Tulip mania</a> of the 17th century to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis">derivatives bubble</a> of the 21st century. For many commentators, the most relevant precedent today is the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZIbEn5oH4jA?si=nAdwGeAtaPaAkvyu">dotcom bubble</a> of the 1990s. Back then, a new technology (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a>) unleashed a wave of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_exuberance">irrational exuberance</a>”. Investors poured billions into any company with “.com” in the name. </p> <p>Three decades later, another new technology has unleashed another wave of exuberance. Investors are pouring billions into any company with “AI” in its name. But there is a crucial difference between these two bubbles, which isn’t always recognised. The World Wide Web existed. It was real. General Artificial Intelligence does not exist, and no one knows <em>if</em> or <em>when</em> it ever will. </p> <p>In February, the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, wrote on his blog that the very latest systems have only just started to “<a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/three-observations">point towards</a>” AI in its “<a href="https://theconversation.com/not-everything-we-call-ai-is-actually-artificial-intelligence-heres-what-you-need-to-know-196732">general</a>” sense. OpenAI may market its products as “AIs”, but they are merely <a href="https://theconversation.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-has-been-called-the-ai-oppenheimer-but-he-dismisses-concerns-ai-is-just-processing-data-256583">statistical data-crunchers</a>, rather than “intelligences” in the sense that human beings are intelligent.</p> <p>So why are investors so keen to give money to the people selling AI systems? One reason might be that AI is a <em>mythical</em> technology. I don’t mean it is a lie. I mean it evokes a powerful, foundational story of Western culture about human powers of creation. </p> <p>Perhaps investors are willing to believe AI is just around the corner because it taps into myths that are deeply ingrained in their imaginations?</p> <h2>The myth of Prometheus</h2> <p>The most relevant myth for AI is the Ancient Greek myth of Prometheus. </p> <p>There are many versions of this myth, but the most famous are found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod">Hesiod</a>’s poems <a href="https://chs.harvard.edu/primary-source/hesiod-theogony-sb/">Theogony</a> and <a href="https://chs.harvard.edu/primary-source/hesiod-works-and-days-sb/">Works and Days</a>, and in the play <a href="https://classics.mit.edu/Aeschylus/prometheus.html">Prometheus Bound</a>, traditionally attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>. </p> <p>Prometheus was a Titan, a god in the Ancient Greek pantheon. He was also a criminal who stole fire from Hephaestus, the blacksmith god. Hiding the fire in a stalk of fennel, Prometheus came to earth and gave it to humankind. As punishment, he was chained to a mountain, where an eagle visited every day to eat his liver.</p> <p>Prometheus’ gift was not simply the gift of fire; it was the gift of intelligence. In Prometheus Bound, he declares that before his gift humans saw without seeing and heard without hearing. After his gift, humans could write, build houses, read the stars, perform mathematics, domesticate animals, construct ships, invent medicines, interpret dreams and give proper offerings to the gods.</p> <p>The myth of Prometheus is a creation story with a difference. In the Hebrew Bible, God does not give Adam the power to create life. But Prometheus gives (some of) the gods’ creative power to humankind.</p> <p>Hesiod indicates this aspect of the myth in Theogony. In that poem, Zeus not only punishes Prometheus for the theft of fire; he punishes humankind as well. He orders Hephaestus to fire up his forge and construct the first woman, Pandora, who unleashes evil on the world.</p> <p>The fire that Hephaestus uses to make Pandora is the same fire that Prometheus has given humankind.</p> <figure class="align-center "> <img alt="Prometheus manufacturing the first man, in an eighteenth-century engraving of an ancient gem in the Carafa Collection." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/703539/original/file-20251119-56-bo2o9v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/703539/original/file-20251119-56-bo2o9v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=422&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703539/original/file-20251119-56-bo2o9v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=422&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703539/original/file-20251119-56-bo2o9v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=422&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703539/original/file-20251119-56-bo2o9v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=531&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703539/original/file-20251119-56-bo2o9v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=531&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703539/original/file-20251119-56-bo2o9v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=531&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px"/> <figcaption> <span class="caption">In this 18th-century engraving, Prometheus constructs the first man.</span> <span class="attribution"><a class="source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PrometheusCarrafa25.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></span> </figcaption> </figure> <p>The Greeks proposed the idea that <em>humans</em> are a form of artificial intelligence. Prometheus and Hephaestus use technology to manufacture men and women. As historian Adrienne Mayor reveals in her book <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691183510/gods-and-robots">Gods and Robots</a>, the ancients often depicted Prometheus as a craftsman, using ordinary tools to create human beings in an ordinary workshop.</p> <p>If Prometheus gave us the fire of the gods, it would seem to follow that we can use this fire to make our own intelligent beings. Such stories abound in Ancient Greek literature, from the inventor Daedalus, who created statues that came to life, to the witch Medea, who could restore youth and potency with her cunning drugs. Greek inventors also constructed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84310-w">mechanical computers for astronomy</a> and remarkable moving figures <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv18msqmt.10?seq=4">powered by gravity, water and air</a>.</p> <h2>The Pope and the chatbot</h2> <p>2,700 years have passed since Hesiod first wrote down the story of Prometheus. In the ensuing centuries, the myth has been endlessly retold, especially since the publication of Mary Shelley’s <a href="https://theconversation.com/frankenstein-how-mary-shelleys-sci-fi-classic-offers-lessons-for-us-today-about-the-dangers-of-playing-god-175520">Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus</a> in 1818.</p> <p>But the myth is not always told as fiction. Here are two historical examples where the myth of Prometheus seemed to come true.</p> <p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sylvester-II">Gerbert of Aurillac</a> was the Prometheus of the 10th century. He was born in the early 940s CE, went to school at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurillac_Abbey">Aurillac Abbey</a>, and became a monk himself. He proceeded to master every known branch of learning. In the year 999, he was elected Pope. He died in 1003 under his pontifical name, Sylvester II.</p> <p>Rumours about Gerbert spread wildly across Europe. Within a century of his death, his life had already become legend. One of the most famous legends, and the most pertinent in our age of AI hype, is that of Gerbert’s “brazen head”. The legend was told in the 1120s by the English historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>, in his well researched and highly regarded book, Deeds of the English Kings. </p> <p>Gerbert was deeply learned in astronomy, a science of prediction. Astronomers could use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe">astrolabe</a> to predict the position of the stars and foresee cosmological events such as eclipses. According to William, Gerbert used his knowledge of astronomy to construct a talking head. After inspecting the movements of the stars and planets, he cast a head in bronze that could answer yes-or-no questions.</p> <p>First Gerbert asked the head: “Will I become Pope?” </p> <p>“Yes,” answered the head. </p> <p>Then Gerbert asked: “Will I die before I sing mass in Jerusalem?” </p> <p>“No,” the head replied. </p> <p>In both cases, the head was correct, though not as Gerbert anticipated. He did become Pope, and he sensibly avoided going on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. One day, however, he sang mass at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Croce_in_Gerusalemme">Santa Croce in Gerusalemme</a> in Rome. Unfortunately for Gerbert, Santa Croce in Gerusalemme was known in those days simply as “Jerusalem”.</p> <p>Gerbert sickened and died. On his deathbed, he asked his attendants to cut up his body and cast away the pieces, so he could go to his true master, Satan. In this way, he was, like Prometheus, punished for his theft of fire. </p> <figure class="align-left zoomable"> <a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/704713/original/file-20251126-56-teuxhj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip"><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/704713/original/file-20251126-56-teuxhj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/704713/original/file-20251126-56-teuxhj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=588&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704713/original/file-20251126-56-teuxhj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=588&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704713/original/file-20251126-56-teuxhj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=588&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704713/original/file-20251126-56-teuxhj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=739&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704713/original/file-20251126-56-teuxhj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=739&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704713/original/file-20251126-56-teuxhj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=739&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px"/></a> <figcaption> <span class="caption">Pope Sylvester II and the Devil.</span> <span class="attribution"><a class="source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Silvester_II._and_the_Devil_Cod._Pal._germ._137_f216v_(cropped).jpg">Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</a></span> </figcaption> </figure> <p>It is a thrilling story. It is not clear whether William of Malmesbury actually believed it. But he does try to persuade his readers that it is plausible. Why did this great historian with a devotion to the truth insert some fanciful legends about a French pope into his history of England? Good question!</p> <p>Is it so fanciful to believe that an advanced astronomer might build a general-purpose prediction machine? In those days, astronomy was the most powerful science of prediction. The sober and scholarly William was at least willing to entertain the idea that brilliant advances in astronomy might make it possible for a Pope to build an intelligent chatbot.</p> <p>Today, that same possibility is credited to machine-learning algorithms, which can predict which ad you will click, which movie you will watch, which word you will type next.

These were clockwork devices that realistically simulated human or animal anatomy. Philosophers of the time believed that the body was a machine – so why couldn’t a machinist build one?</p> <p>Sometimes Vaucanson’s automata were scientifically significant. He constructed a piper, for example, that had lips and lungs and fingers, and blew the pipe in much the same way a human would. Historian Jessica Riskin explains in her book <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo21519800.html">The Restless Clock</a> that Vaucanson had to make significant discoveries in acoustics in order to make his piper play in tune.</p> <p>Sometimes his automata were less scientific. His <a href="https://historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=412">digesting duck</a> was hugely famous, but turned out to be fraudulent. It appeared to eat and digest food, but its poos were in fact prefabricated pellets hidden inside the mechanism.</p> <p>Vaucanson spent decades working on what he called a “moving anatomy”. In 1741, he presented a plan to the Lyons Academy to build an “imitation of all animal operations”. Twenty years later, he was at it again. He secured support from King Louis XV to build a simulation of the circulatory system. He claimed he could build a complete, living artificial body.</p> <figure class="align-center zoomable"> <a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/704711/original/file-20251126-74-gx4f2x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip"><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/704711/original/file-20251126-74-gx4f2x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/704711/original/file-20251126-74-gx4f2x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=320&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704711/original/file-20251126-74-gx4f2x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=320&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704711/original/file-20251126-74-gx4f2x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=320&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704711/original/file-20251126-74-gx4f2x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=402&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704711/original/file-20251126-74-gx4f2x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=402&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704711/original/file-20251126-74-gx4f2x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=402&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px"/></a> <figcaption> <span class="caption">Three of Vaucanson’s famous automata: the Flute Player, the Digesting Duck, and the Provençal Farmer, who played the pipe and tambourine.</span> <span class="attribution"><a class="source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jouets_M%C3%A9caniques_de_Vaucanson_;_Un_Sauvage,_un_berger_provencal_et_un_canard_cropped.jpg">Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</a></span> </figcaption> </figure> <p>There is no evidence that Vaucanson ever completed a whole body.

A corpus! Thanks to the hard work of Niles Zhao, the homo calculans project now possesses a corpus of articles, books and chapters from the early years of the Computational Human Sciences. The field was vaster than either of us expected. When we started the project, I expected that we would be able to get essentially all the articles from the period that reported on computer-enabled research. Boy was I wrong. By the mid-1960s, there was already a large community of computational humanists and social scientists, and research methods were rapidly maturing. Experimentalism was rife. Computer power was, it seems, relatively abundant. In this post, I will just sketch the outlines of the corpus, relying on the metadata Niles has collected about the articles, books, and chapters, and the annotations he has made about research disciplines and the available hardware. Code corpus &lt;- readr::read_csv("corpus-2025-initial.csv",) |&gt; # normalise tags dplyr::mutate(tag = stringr::str_split(`Manual Tags`, ";")) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(tag = purrr::map(tag, \(t) stringr::str_trim(t))) corpus_n &lt;- nrow(corpus) corpus_n_with_text &lt;- corpus |&gt; dplyr::filter(!is.na(`File Attachments`)) |&gt; nrow() types_n &lt;- unique(corpus$`Item Type`) |&gt; length() What’s in it? In this present state, the corpus includes 399 academic texts. We have pdfs for 387 of these, though hopefully we will be able to increase this proportion before the project ends. The corpus includes 6 kinds of text, though it is dominated by Journal Articles, as shown in Figure&nbsp;1. Code corpus |&gt; ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(`Item Type`)) + ggplot2::geom_bar() + ggplot2::scale_x_discrete(labels = c( "book" = "Book", "bookSection" = "Chapter", "conferencePaper" = "Conference Paper", "journalArticle" = "Journal Article", "magazineArticle" = "Magazine Article", "report" = "Report" )) Figure&nbsp;1: The items in the corpus are mostly journal articles, as expected. Which disciplines are represented? Who was doing this research in the 1950s and 60s? Which disciplines were at the forefront? We were hoping to be able to give crisp, empirical answers to these questions, but the literature turned out to be so large that is has proven hard to sample the population. For now, we can just see which disciplines appear to be represented in the corpus that we have. Niles tagged the items in Zotero, which is great because it is flexible, but not so great because the tags are unstructured. First we need to sort the tags into two groups: discipline tags and technology tags. Code # Get list of tags for categorisation corpus |&gt; tidyr::unnest(c(tag)) |&gt; dplyr::distinct(tag) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(tag_category = "") |&gt; readr::write_csv("all-tags.csv") # Import categorised tags tag_categories &lt;- readr::read_csv("all-tags-categorised.csv") Once we have (very roughly) categorised the tags, we can take a look at the summary statistics. Figure&nbsp;2 shows the disciplines represented in the corpus. The corpus already suggests new lines of inquiry. The social science disciplines are not so surprising, but it is intriguing to note the presence of many Visual Arts and Musiology articles. These disciplines do not feature heavily in the mainstream historiography of Digital Humanities, which has tended to focus on early efforts in literature and linguistics. Code disciplines &lt;- corpus |&gt; tidyr::unnest(c(tag)) |&gt; dplyr::left_join(tag_categories, by="tag") |&gt; dplyr::filter(tag_category == "discipline", !is.na(tag)) |&gt; dplyr::group_by(tag) |&gt; dplyr::filter(dplyr::n() &gt; 1) disciplines |&gt; ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(y=tag)) + ggplot2::geom_bar() + ggplot2::labs( y="Discipline", x=glue::glue("Number of Articles (n = {nrow(disciplines)}).") ) Figure&nbsp;2: Musicology and Visual Arts have probably been overlooked in the early history of CHS. Disciplines with only one article excluded. What computers were in use? Code computers &lt;- corpus |&gt; tidyr::unnest(c(tag)) |&gt; dplyr::left_join(tag_categories, by="tag") |&gt; dplyr::filter(tag_category == "computer", !is.na(tag)) The computer tags also paint an intriguing picture of the early period of CHS. 74 distinct models of computer are mentioned in the corpus—we may find more as we dig deeper. Although there are many models in the corpus, a few big brands or lines of computer dominate, as shown in Figure&nbsp;3. Code computers |&gt; dplyr::select(tag) |&gt; dplyr::mutate( tag=stringr::str_remove(tag, "Computer: "), brand=stringr::str_extract(tag, "\\w+") ) |&gt; ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(y=brand)) + ggplot2::geom_bar() + ggplot2::labs( y="Brand", x=glue::glue("Models Mentioned (n = {nrow(computers)} mentions in {length(unique(computers$Key))} articles)") ) Figure&nbsp;3: Unsurprisingly, IBM dominated the early days of CHS. Figure&nbsp;3 will be unsurprisng to readers familiar with the history of computers. IBM was the dominant manufacturer of large computers in this period. By the mid-sixties, mini-computers were becoming more popular, two of the most famous brands being Control Data Corporation (CDC) and Digital Equipment Corporation (who manufactured the PDP line of computers). The Illiac computers present a fascinating case of early use of computation in the Human Sciences. As well as a statistical machine, it was a machine for musical composition, and was used to create the Illiac Suite (Hiller and Baker 1964). You can listen to part of the suite on Spotify: Where to from here? Next, we need to tidy up the corpus a bit, and get the text of the articles into R. Then we can get to the meat of the homo calculans project—the discourse of Computational Human Sciences in the 1950s and 60s. What did these early pioneers think they were doing? How did they justify there strange experiments in computational method? I am excited to find out… Image credit: Alice (Betsy) E. D. Gillies and Donald B.
