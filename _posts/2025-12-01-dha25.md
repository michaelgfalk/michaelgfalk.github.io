[DHA25](https://dha25.org) is upon us. So is the annual meeting of the [Canadian Australian Partnership for Open Scholarship](https://inke.ca/re-defining-open-social-scholarship-in-an-age-of-generative-intelligence/). I have had great fun putting the conference together as a member of the [aaDH Executive](https://aa-dh.org) and [conference organising committee](https://dha25.org/info/organisers/). I will be giving quite a few presentations at the conference. I've collected all the slides here where I'm first author:

## Tuesday 2nd December, at the [CAPOS meeting](https://inke.ca/re-defining-open-social-scholarship-in-an-age-of-generative-intelligence/)

I'm presenting my research on the Abstract Wikipedia project: [Wikilambda the Ultimate](https://michaelgfalk.quarto.pub/wikilambda-the-ultimate/).

I'm giving a short reflection on the question, [What would it take for AI to be open?](https://michaelgfalk.quarto.pub/what-would-it-take-for-ai-to-be-open/) (I'm greatly inspired by the [Swiss AI](https://www.swiss-ai.org/apertus) project.)

## Wednesday the 3rd, at DHA25 Day 1

I'm presenting with Nick Thieberger and Peter Sefton on *ROCrate for a data commons*. I'm there mostly for my work on the [OHRM Upload Project](https://figshare.unimelb.edu.au/projects/OHRM_Upload_Project/230466).

## Thursday the 4th, at DHA Day 2

I'm running a Critical Code Studies workshop with the [Anticodians](https://anticodians.org), where we will close-read Peter Norvig's [*lis.py* essay](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1slHI9tYeP4sSP-c1FCVnK0VFs3g_tejq) ([here's the original](https://www.norvig.com/lispy.html)). To kick things off, I will give a lightning talk on [Scheme and its Ideologies](https://michaelgfalk.quarto.pub/scheme-and-its-ideologies/).

In the afternoon, I will present some of the work that Niles Zhao and I have done on the [*homo calculans*](https://homo-calculans.blog) project. [Here are the slides](https://michaelfalk.io/homo-calculans-presentation).

## Friday the 5th, at DHA Day 3

I'm not presenting. (Phew!) But I'll be chairing a panel with [Finn Morgan](https://www.fiannualamorgan.com/) and Claire Loughnane, my colleagues from Melbourne, and Francesca Sidoti, my colleague on the [wikihistories](https://wikihistories.net) project.
